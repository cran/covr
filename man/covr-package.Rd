\title{covr: Test coverage for packages}
\description{
covr tracks and reports code coverage for your package and (optionally)
upload the results to a coverage service like 'Codecov' \url{http://codecov.io} or
'Coveralls' \url{http://coveralls.io}. Code coverage is a measure of the amount of
code being exercised by a set of tests. It is an indirect measure of test
quality and completeness. This package is compatible with any testing
methodology or framework and tracks coverage of both R code and compiled
C/C++/FORTRAN code.
}
\details{
A coverage report can be used to inspect coverage for each line in your
package. Using \code{report()} requires \href{https://github.com/rstudio/shiny}{shiny}.\preformatted{# If run with no arguments `report()` implicitly calls `package_coverage()`
report()
}
